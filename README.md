# Portfolio

Website, which is my resume - both its code and content as well. I have learnt enourmous bunch of things during creating it, and I am aware that it still have imperfections. But actually I can feel the difference even between the first (animate-on-scroll.js) and the last script (form-validation.js), and I'm not slowing down!

You can see it [here](http://monikakowalewska.pl). I hope You enjoy!
