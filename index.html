            I just love making things useful and pretty.
          </h2>

            <p>For the past 10 years I was booking ferry departures for cargo trucks.
  Kind of useful, definitely not pretty.</p>

  <p>I’m almost 30 and, to be honest, I have no time to be a shitty developer. So I decided to be an awesome one! I am making it happen everyday, step by step. I am so determined, that I was coding hidden in the closet, so that kids didn’t find me (thanks for nothing, coronavirus!).
  I may be a #CodeNewbie, but certainly not an employee newbie. I am nothing like 19-year-old me, who sat at the desk at the first day of new job and was trying to look smart. Thanks to previous work and maternity I learnt to:
  •	make a team with coworkers (even with those who haven’t washed their cups)
  •	organize my work (at first, be sure what is expected from me)
  •	working under pressure (with client phoning every 2 minutes, asking „is it already done?” or with a daughter, asking every 2 seconds „mommy, is it already done?”)</p>

  <p>I love making things useful and pretty for users and other developers.
  To take care of high accesibility and beautiful animations, as well as clean, quality code and variable’s names that make sense.</p>
