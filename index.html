          What's my story? In 2019, just before Christmas, I figured out what I
          want from my job: to be curious of what I'm doing and how. To be able
          to create one thing in 100 ways and try to pick the best one. To be an
          artist a little bit. And guess what? I realised that my current job
          doesnâ€™t give it to me. Also I really wanted to earn some hard skills.
          That's how frontend happened and I just fell in love with it. I have
          over 7 years experience with working in the team, working and
          communicating with clients (foreign also), delivering before deadline,
          achieving business targets. I am not a newbie at the work market. As
          for frontend, I am quick learner and I test all gained knowledge in
          projects. If I am not sure of something, I read, listen, watch and
          ask, until I get it. My inspirations are Hedy Lamarr and Dan Abramov.
          Today I am constantly in my learning process and I use: - HTML5
          (fluent), - CSS (medium) / SCSS (basic), - JavaScript (basic), > GIT
          (basic). Privately mom of two little girls.
